## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass SCSS syntax
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project I practiced my CSS and JavaScript skills. In case of CSS it was practicing writing Sass. In case of JavaScript it was managing the app state, validating inputs, manipulating DOM and formating numbers and values using the localization API.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to get more comfortable with using CSS Grid and use it where it's more appropriate.
